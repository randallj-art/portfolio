                    My name is Randall Johanningsmeier, and I am an artist currently based in Omaha, Nebraska. I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2024, with an undergraduate degree in studio art and mathematics.
                <br><br>
                    I primarily make oil paintings these days, but I have often worked with other media and methods such as drawing, acrylic painting, woodworking, printmaking, and quilting. I don't like to limit myself.
                <br><br>
                    My latest projects all celebrate the beautiful, intricate patterns that I find in the interaction between light and complex structures. Because of my interest in structure and in the reflective properties of glass, the subjects of my paintings are often architectural.
                <br><br>
                    When I am not painting or drawing, I spend much of my time with other forms of art: I read, write, act in plays, think deeply about mathematics, and make music. To me, everything is connected.
